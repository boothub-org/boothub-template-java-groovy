[[build]]
== Build

After generating the project skeleton and creating a working copy on your computer, you can build the project with:

----
gradle build
----

Let us consider that your project is called `my-project` and consists of three modules: `myproject-core`, `myproject-api` and `myproject-demo`.
Also, let us consider that you specified that the project should have a main application class named `MyDemo` in the `myproject-demo` module.

Then, you can build an uncompressed distribution by executing:
----
gradle installDist
----

Running the start script found in the `myproject-demo/build/install/myProject/bin` directory, the following text should appear on your terminal:
----
Hello from MyDemo!
----

[[idea]]
== IntelliJ Idea

- start the IntelliJ Idea IDE
- if your project uses Groovy or Spock: make sure that the Groovy plugin is enabled
- open _build.gradle_


[[eclipse]]
== Eclipse

- start the Eclipse IDE
- if your project uses Groovy or Spock: install the https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/wiki#releases[Groovy plugin]
- install a recent version of https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Buildship]
- import the project using the Gradle Project wizard

[[versioning]]
== Versioning

The file `gradle.properties` contains variables that are used to create a version string conforming to the https://semver.org[semantic versioning] standard.
The names of these variables are prefixed by the camelCase representation of the project name, for example:
`myProjectVersionMajor`, `myProjectVersionMinor`, `myProjectVersionPatch`.

Additionally, a boolean variable (named for example `myProjectReleaseBuild`) is used to specify whether the current build represents a release or a snapshot.

By editing the values of these variables you can change the version of your project.

For example, to bump your project version to `1.2.3-SNAPSHOT` your `gradle.properties` should contain:
----
myProjectVersionMajor = 1
myProjectVersionMinor = 2
myProjectVersionPatch = 3
myProjectReleaseBuild = false
----


[[travis]]
== Travis CI

If your project is on GitHub, you will benefit from the https://travis-ci.com/[Travis] configuration and script files generated by BootHub.
Besides building the project and running the tests, Travis also executes the tasks responsible for publishing the documentation (AsciiDoc und javadoc/groovydoc)
and for managing the list of release-specific links.

In order to allow Travis to take care of your project you need to perform a few actions.
Some of the steps described below are one-time operations that may be skipped if they have already been executed.


. authorize Travis as OAuth application for your GitHub account (if not already authorized):
** open https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci
** click 'Set up a free trial'
** in the 'Pricing and Setup' section select 'Open Source'
** click 'Install it for free'
** click 'Complete order and begin installation'
** click 'Authorize travis-ci'

. create the `publishGhPages` Personal Access Token on Github (if not already created):
** go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new to generate the new token (click https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/[here] for more details)
*** enter `publishGhPages` as token description
*** select `public_repo` as scope (or `repo` if your repository is private)
*** click `Generate token`
** save the generated token for future use in a secure place (you will not be able to see it again!)

. activate Travis for your project
** copy the `publishGhPages` token to clipboard
** open https://travis-ci.org
** go to your Travis profile page (\https://travis-ci.org/profile/<your-github-username>)
** find your project in the repository list and activate it (click `Sync account` and press `F5` if your project does not appear in the list)
** go to the Travis Settings page of your project (\https://travis-ci.org/<your-github-username>/<your-github-repo>/settings)
** under `Environment Variables` add a variable named `GH_PAGES_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the token value you copied to the clipboard.
*** make sure that 'Display value in build log' is OFF
*** click `ADD`.

Travis is now ready to build your project.
To trigger a new build you need to make a change to your project and push it to GitHub.

[[doc_publishing]]
== Automatic documentation publishing

If Travis is enabled for your GitHub project, it publishes the AsciiDoc and javadoc/groovydoc to https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#project-pages[GitHub Project Pages].

It also publishes and updates the list of release-specific links:

image::release-list.png[]

The `README.md` file generated by BootHub contains links to the AsciiDoc and javadoc/groovydoc of the latest release, as well as a link to the list of release-specific links:

image::readme.png[]

NOTE: The links in the `README.md` file shown above become valid only after Travis has completed its first build.


=== Custom domain name

If you have specified a custom domain name for the GitHub Pages site during the project generation, BootHub has created a `CNAME` file in the `ghpages` directory.
This `CNAME` file, which contains the custom domain name, will be pushed to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub project when Travis builds your project for the first time.
(If you have not specified a custom domain name during the project generation, you can also https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/[add a custom domain] later.)

To access your GitHub Pages site using a custom domain you need to set up the custom domain with your DNS provider,
as described in the last of the step of https://help.github.com/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain/[this document].
